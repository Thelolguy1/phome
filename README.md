# Phome
This project aims to mimic proprietary device location services, including those from Apple and Google. In order to support community-created implementations of Phome, this repository includes both the phomeCore framework package and a reference CLI-only client (package main).

Please note that phomeCore's TLS self-signing code is licensed under Go's BSD-like license, provided in the file "SUBLICENSE".
